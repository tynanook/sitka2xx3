This sheet is placed into a J750 program to take advantage of the Mchp_QTP_SQTP_Classed_Dev.xla.  This library allows the variables to be ,,,,,
stored in the test program and are easily modified to allow for changes and corrections.  Now new devices can be added to the program without,,,,,
having to release a new library.  This means that S/QTP programs can be rmodified/eleased immediately.,,,,,
Each family has a unique sheet and object in the library.,,,,,
